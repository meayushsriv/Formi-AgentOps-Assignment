## Project Overview

This project is aimed at building a conversational chatbot agent for Barbeque Nation outlets in Delhi and Bangalore. The chatbot handles inbound enquiries including FAQs, new bookings, booking modifications (like rescheduling or cancellations), and complaint logging. It uses multiple integrations such as webhooks, Google Sheets, Pabbly Connect, Cal.com, and conversational AI hooks to manage smooth booking and communication flows.

## Purpose

The chatbot agent is designed to:

- Answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) promptly and accurately.
- Allow customers to book new reservations seamlessly.
- Support modification of existing bookings such as reschedules and cancellations.
- Log customer complaints and feedback for quality assurance.
- Maintain conversational flow using state management and AI hooks.

## System Architecture

The system is composed of the following key components:

| Component                   | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **State Prompt**            | Templates that maintain the chatbotâ€™s current conversational state and context.             |
| **State Transition Prompt** | Logic that governs moving from one conversation state to the next based on user input.      |
| **Knowledge Base**          | Structured property, booking, and FAQ data used for generating chatbot responses.           |
| **Post-Call Configuration** | Mechanism to log conversation outcomes, feedback, and call summaries for analysis.          |
| **Chatbot Interface**       | The user-facing conversational interface built using Retell AI and custom API integrations. |
| **Webhook Handlers**        | Endpoints to receive and process real-time booking updates, especially reschedules.         |
| **Automation Workflow**     | Pabbly Connect flows to automate booking entries and sync data across systems.              |

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Forking and Repository Setup

The project started by forking the `agentops-template-repo` which provides starter code and API scaffolding for chatbot agents.

### 2. Knowledge Base Preparation

- Data was structured across multiple Google Sheets tabs for easy management:
  - `locationDB` (property and branch info)
  - `FAQ` (frequently asked questions)
  - `Booking` (reservations records)
  - `Complaint/Feedback` (customer feedback)
  - `Modification` (booking changes)
  - `AvailabilityLog` (table tracking real-time availability)
  - `My Agent Responses` (preset chatbot replies)
  - `Knowledge Bases Used` (consolidated reference data)

### 3. API Development

- Created RESTful API endpoints to:
  - Fetch segmented knowledge base data in chunks to fit API token limits.
  - Create, update, or cancel bookings through webhook integration.
  - Log detailed post-call summaries for each conversation.
  - Manage conversational states and transitions.

### 4. Pabbly Connect Workflow

- Automated workflows were created to:
  - Add new bookings to the `Booking` Google Sheet automatically from Cal.com reservation data.
  - Listen for booking reschedule events via webhook and update records accordingly.
  - Sync booking data and availability statuses across sheets and chatbot responses.

### 5. Conversational AI Hook Configuration

- Configured Text Cortex AI hooks and router hooks to control chatbot dialog flows dynamically.

## Implementation Walkthrough

### Step 1: New Booking Creation

- Customers book reservations using **Cal.com** booking interface.
- Bookings are automatically pushed into the Google Sheets `Booking` tab via **Pabbly Connect** integration.

---

### Step 2: Booking Modification Handling (Rescheduling)

- A webhook endpoint listens for reschedule events from the booking system.
- When a booking is rescheduled, the webhook receives an update and modifies the corresponding Google Sheet row in `Booking`.

---

### Step 3: Conversational AI Configuration

- Configured **Text Cortex AI Hooks** for generating dynamic responses based on conversational context.
- Set up **Router Hooks** to handle state transitions depending on user inputs and chatbot interactions.

---

### Step 4: Knowledge Base & FAQ Handling

- The FAQs and other knowledge data are stored in Google Sheets with chunking logic to keep each API response within token limits.
- The chatbot queries the knowledge base dynamically to answer customer queries accurately.

### Step 5: Conversation Logging & Post-Call Analysis

- After each conversation or call, data including call time, call outcome, booking details, and customer feedback is logged in the `Post-Call Analysis` sheet.
- This log enables the business to analyze conversation quality and customer satisfaction.
